This repo is going to be a better version of my private university repo. Should be more reflective of real world repositories, and the information put in them

# User Story

## Persona

### Name:
Jane Smith
### Role:
Care Worker at Fake Care Home

To ensure residents receive accurate and timely care, and to efficiently document and review care-related information

# User Tasks And Goals:

## Log a care note for a resident
Jane navigates to the Add Care Note tab. She searches for the resident by ID
She enters the care note details and hits add care notes

## Check the Number of Positive v Negative Care Notes
Jane navigates to the View Care Notes tab and selects a resident id.
The application then displays the number of positive, neutral and negative care notes and their related percentages
The application should also display the care note text

## Log a new resident
Jane navigates to the Add a New Resident tab and inputs resident info
She selects add new resident
The UI should make it obvious it has worked
If she goes to the view residents tab the new resident should be visible
